				<p class="description">I have always had a love for problem solving and a desire to work with technology. It was this trait that lead me to eventually explore and love the field of computer programming. Web development not only offers me a way to satiate my need for figuring things out, but I could use my skill to make products that people could enjoy.
				</p>
				<p class="description">
				My experience with programming started in my undergraduate studies, where I took two classes in computer science. I was introduced to both the Python and Java programming languages and got my first taste for high-level programming concepts. When I realized that the sciences were no longer for me, I applied to the Web Development Immersive program at General Assembly. Here, I'm learning all of the concepts needed to be an entry level developer, including HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript. A Sample of some of my projects arew listed in the boxes on this site.
